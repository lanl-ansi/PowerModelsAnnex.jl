#### AC Optimal Power Flow ####

# This file provides a pedagogical example of modeling the AC Optimal Power
# Flow problem using the Julia Mathematical Programming package (JuMP) and the
# PowerModels package for data parsing.

# This file can be run by calling `include("ac-opf.jl")` from the Julia REPL or
# by calling `julia ac-opf.jl` in Julia v0.6.

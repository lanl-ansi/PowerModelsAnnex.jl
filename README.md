# PowerModelsAnnex.jl
[PowerModels.jl](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModels.jl) provides an implementation reference for *established* formulations and methods in power system optimization, and hence is is not an appropriate location for more exploratory work.  PowerModelsAnnex.jl is an extension of PowerModels.jl that provides a home for open-source sharing preliminary and/or exploratory methods in power system optimization.

Due to the exploritoy nature of PowerModelsAnnex,
- there is minimal documentation and testing
- there are limited code quality and reliablity standards
- anything goes in the annex, more-or-less

Users should be prepared for features that break.

Pull Requests to PowerModelsAnnex are always welcome and not subject to significant scrutiny.
